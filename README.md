## Hey, I'm Abhinay 👋

Software engineer with 8+ years building complex frontend systems - design systems,
microfrontend platforms, workflow engines, and real-time multiplayer applications.
Currently at an AI-native startup, expanding into AI product engineering: building the
layer where model capabilities meet real user experience.

I care about clean architecture, thoughtful UX, and building systems that actually
work for humans - especially when the underlying technology is non-deterministic.

### What I'm Working On

**AI product engineering:** Retrieval-augmented generation, evaluation
pipelines, and the UX challenges of non-deterministic systems. Building at the
intersection of frontend architecture and AI integration.

**Frontend systems at depth:** Microfrontend platforms, component
architectures, and the kind of JavaScript/TypeScript that requires understanding
the engine, not just the framework.

**Full-stack AI tools:** Python backends with React/TypeScript frontends,
where the interface is as considered as the model.
