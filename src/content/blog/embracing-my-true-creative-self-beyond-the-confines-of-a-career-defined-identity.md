In present times, human identity is often tightly intertwined with one's chosen career path. Society places a strong emphasis on professional success, leading many to believe that their worth as individuals is primarily defined by their occupation. However, it is essential to question whether this should truly be the essence of our human identity. Should we allow our careers to solely define us, or is there more to us than our work?

Living in urban societies, where the standards of living are high and the pace of life is fast, a successful career is often seen as essential for maintaining the desired lifestyle. The pursuit of financial stability and material comfort drives individuals to seek careers that promise stability, prestige, and financial rewards. This societal pressure to conform and meet these standards can be overwhelming, causing individuals to prioritize their professional pursuits and neglect other areas of life.

But let us pause and reflect. Shouldn't our human identity be the expression of our authentic selves, free from the limitations of societal expectations? The true essence lies not in the pursuit of external validation but in our ability to embrace and express our creativity.

Personally, I too fell into the trap of measuring the value of my ideas solely based on their potential career benefits. I confined my creative expressions within the narrow confines of marketability and societal expectations. This led me down a path of unfinished projects, each abandoned because they did not fit the predetermined career trajectory I had envisioned for myself.

However, I have chosen a different course now. I have made the decision to transform all of my ideas into free and open-source projects, breaking them free from the confines of being mere resume builders. My focus is no longer on personal gain but on selflessly sharing the value I create with others.

For instance, through my passion for online game development, I strive to create peer-to-peer multiplayer games that eliminate the need for centralized hosting. By making these games more accessible and affordable for all, I aim to foster a loyal community built on shared joy and social interaction.

Moreover, I seek to develop decentralized apps and self-hosted progressive web apps, empowering individuals to reclaim control over their data and privacy. I envision a future where creativity knows no bounds, where ideas are freely shared, and where the joy of creation becomes a universal language.

In embracing this new path, I am reclaiming my creative expression as a developer. I value projects that resonate with my authentic self, transcending the limitations of societal expectations. By pursuing ideas that bring me fulfillment and allow me to make a positive impact on others, I am redefining my identity beyond the boundaries of a career-centric world. I am discovering the true essence of who I am as a human being, and in doing so, I am giving my creative spirit the freedom it deserves.
